# Project Proposal

## Name of Student: Liam Cammpbell

## Name of Project: Working title - Dog Bark

## Projects Purpose or goal: To improve a user's dog park experience by informing them of the best time to go. 

## Absolute minimum features 

* A user can enter information about their dog, i.e. size, name. likes and dislikes...

* A user can say they are taking their dog to the park

* A user can list other dogs as their dog's friends and see when they are at the park.

## Tools, frameworks, and libraries

* AWS - DynamoDB, Amplify, Graphql

* React

* JavaScript

## Stretch Goals

* Add multiple parks

* Notifications when it is a good time to go to the park

* A system that tracks which dogs are at the park and let you know when a good time to go is based on your dog's likes and dislikes

* Tips for a more successful dog park visit

## Additional tools

* I think I can cover this all with AWS and React, but will have to do more research on notifications after getting past the MVP.

# Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* I did a lot of reading about NoSQL, but am still unsure of how data is structured, hopefully as we use it more in class this will become more clear.

*  I chose to use AWS because it has been mentioned frequently in job postings that I see.
